It has rained some part of
almost every day for the past
two weeks. The nights are
always cool and I sleep
under two blankets. We made
two wonderful trips – on
Tuesday to Uriage, where we
visited the Chateau and drank
a bottle of wine at a farm
from which we looked out over
a hazy valley; and on
Wednesday to Grande
Chartreuse to visit the
monastery.

We have decided to spend
our last month at Tours and
have already heard from
Mme. Grepilloux saying that
she can take us in, I think
pretty much on our terms. I
look forward to having a
happy time there – and
wonder if Mme. G. is as
gracious and pleasant as
she is in my recollection.
