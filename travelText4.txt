On Monday we made 396 miles;
on Tuesday 387; on
Wednesday 393. 

There is a high wind today
and the ship is rolling
heavier than at any other
time. But no one seems to be
sick; on the contrary, there
is considerable gaiety.

Tuesday was a sunny day;
yesterday started off with
rain early and the rest of the
day alternated between clear
and cloudy.

We are stiff from playing
shuffle board.

I have been reading
“Lord Jim” and
“Gullivers Travels.”

How quiet and restful it is.

The last two logs were as
follows – Thursday, 375 miles,
Friday 381 (On that, the last
day of the ship’s pool, I won
the pool of ten dollars.). We
were to arrive at Plymouth
Saturday at 9 P.M. but a heavy
fog came up suddenly about 8
o’clock and the ship stopped
completely for a time. We
finally came up with the tender,
rather it came up with us, at
about 10. The following day we
came in to Le Havre at about 2:30
or 3. Fog hid the sky and clung
to the sea, which was pale green,
absolutely calm. The sun, behind
the fog, gave a diffused yellow
light that seemed to emanate from
all sides. We moved silently,
enchanted.
