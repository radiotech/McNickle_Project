We went to our first concert
tonight – to hear Brownislaw
Huberman. A mediocre
violinist, I thought, with a
heavy, unpleasant tone. He was
especially disappointing in
the first two numbers,
something by Hindemith (whoever
he is) and a fugue in e minor
from Bach. Later, is Cesar
Franck, the violin sonata
(e minor) and E. Lallo’s
“Spanish Symphony,” he seemed
to get warmed up and to gain
in dexterity. 

It has been cloudy today but
warmer than yesterday. No sun,
no rain.

Huberman is already turning
old, bald-headed (he parts the
few remaining wisps of hair
carefully over the bald spot)
and has a habit of crouching
over his fiddle as if it were
something slippery and on the
point of getting away from him.
His lower lip protrudes sharply
and gives him an aspect not
unlike Mussolini’s. He was born
in 1882, a Pole.
