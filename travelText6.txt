Footnote on starting a
business in Paris.

Madame, our landlady (she is
Swedish and her husband
Scotch), intends to open a
tea-room and gift shop on
Boule. [Montparnasse or
Montjarnasse]. This is what
was required of her: first she
had to give 200,000 fr. to the
holder of the lease on the
property she wished to occupy.
This sum had nothing to do with
the rent, which she must pay
besides, but in a sense
represents a purchase of “good
will.” She was not allowed to
choose her own architect for
altering the property but must
accept the person chosen by the
owner of the building. Finally,
before any work could be
started, she had to deposit
25,000 fr. in the bank, not in
her name nor that of her
attorney, but in the
architect’s name, over whom,
apparently, she has no control
whatever but must depend
entirely on his honesty
and discretion.
