We left New York yesterday on
the S.S. Lancastria bound for
Le Havre and Paris.
Everything leading up to and
directly concerned with the
leave taking came off
beautifully. We are
extremely happy.

In New York the leaves were
just appearing on the elms
in Madison and Washington
Squares. About three weeks
previously the cherry trees in
Central Park had begun
to blossom. 

The first day out we made 258
miles; The next, 386; and
yesterday, 373. Up to now the
trip has been very depressing;
cloudy, raining, rough enough
to upset most stomachs, very
dull. The passengers are made
up for most part of returning
Englishmen most of them
elderly, and none of
them amusing.

This afternoon, things took a
turn for the better, and
tonight I ate dinner with
a revived appetite. 

Late Saturday afternoon I met
an Englishman, an accountant
in N.Y., and spoke too freely
in our first introductory
remarks â€“ a circumstance that
seemed for a time destined to
make all other contacts
impossible. But that too has
passed, I hope.
