Joran and I have joined up for
a class with Robert Frost
called “The Bounds of Poetry”
at the New School for Social
Research. Tonight we attended
the first lecture. The room
was crowded. The new windows
wouldn’t work well and when
people tried to shut them they
flew open. The room
got too hot.

Frost came in, nervous, when he
tried to talk he actually
trembled, his throat seemed
dry. Only once or twice did he
forget himself sufficiently to
look directly at paper. 

And the people! One didn’t know
whether to despise them or to
be merely self-conscious with
them. One man behind us laughed
out loud at things that were
only whimsical and sometimes
delicate. When he tried to draw
out comments people began at once
to insist he read his own poetry
(He had been reading out of
Untermeyer’s anthology – reading
with revelations). One strong
voiced Jewish girl howled out
“Read the death of the hired man!”
after he had several times insisted
that he would not read any of his
own things until possibly
the last lecture.
